Library Management System Project
Overview

This Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to facilitate the management of a library's collection of books. It provides functionalities for adding new books, searching for books, checking out books, returning books, and more. The project aims to demonstrate understanding of Python concepts including basic programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and exception handling.
Features

    Add new books to the library.
    Display all books in the library.
    Search for a book by title.
    Check out a book.
    Return a book.
    Display checked-out books.
    Save and load library data to/from a file using JSON format.
    Case-insensitive search functionality.
    Proper input validation and error handling.

Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

    Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    Run the library_management_system.py file using the command python library_management_system.py.

Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu of options. Follow the prompts to perform various actions such as adding a book, searching for a book, checking out a book, returning a book, and viewing checked-out books. Input validation is implemented to ensure correct usage of the system.
Implementation Details

    The initial version of the system is implemented using functions and lists to manage book data.
    The code is later refactored to use classes and objects for a more structured approach, with the implementation of the Library and Book classes.
    Data persistence is achieved by saving and loading library data to/from a file using JSON format.
    Search functionality is enhanced to handle case-insensitive searches.
    Proper input validation and error handling are incorporated throughout the program to handle user inputs and unexpected scenarios.
